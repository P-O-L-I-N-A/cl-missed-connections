My project idea is a dating app that utilizes Craigslist Missed Connections.

While perusing Craigslist Missed Connections I noticed similarities in all the
posts, such as location, hair color, action, etc., and wondered if there could be
an easier way of searching this database to see if someone had been searching
for you.

The success rate of Missed Connections is abysmally low -- I'd like to increase it.

Those who would use this app are people who have had a lovely encounter with a
stranger and would like to know if that stranger is searching for them too.

Right now the user is able to post a 'Lonely', which takes the information about
the missed encounter: location, gender, hair, clothes, car and text; look up the
entire database of 'Lonelies' or missed connections; find and update a single
'Lonely' in case the user made a mistake in recalling the color of the car that
the encounter took place; and finally, the best one of all is 'love a lonely' or
delete a missed connection from the database.

This app is still in development. Right now a user is unable to search the
database of 'Lonelies' to see if someone else had posted about them. I've created
the button and the form field for the comparison however, I've commented it out until I
can figure out the logic. Figuring out the logic of the comparison will be challenging
but not impossible.

Please stay tuned for improvements!
